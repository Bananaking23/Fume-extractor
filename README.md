# Fume-extractor
I decided to make a fume extractor as i dont have anything of this kind in my room and thats where i solder.
It uses a carbon filter, motor speed controller and a 12v fan. it connects using a dc power jack.

the case fits together using 8 m3 heat inserts and the rest slides in. This took me about 2 hours to design as im not very experienced with 3d modelling
all the parts are easily dissasembled and u can reach inside the base without taking it all apart.
